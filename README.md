# Attendance Tracker & Management System
Technologies used:  HTML5, CSS3, PHP and MySQL.

## Project Description
  Attendance Tracker could be an award-winning project for college students or beginners in the field of cloud computing. The tracker works fine with Azure cloud that manages     the analytics and networking of cloud-oriented applications well. As soon as we enter a student’s Enrollment Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of     lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by Azure cloud capabilities. Even the security offered is so robust and           powerful that those naughty students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span – just after the admin enters login details into this tracker. All this will       improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and         absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced costs.
